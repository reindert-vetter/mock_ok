This folder contains serialized CIF response objects.

To add a new response object go to
AbstractCifWebService::soapCall()

The output of "serialize($response)" for the response object of "$response = $client->__soapCall($method, [$method => $params]);"
should be put in a file with the same name of the Soap Method which has been called.

This seemed to be the most easy way of mocking Cif responses.
