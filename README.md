# Twins
Twins in a mock server for Laravel. Every external request first passes through Twins. Twins will execute the request once and save the response. The stored response is used as a mock for the next request. Although Twins runs in a different docker container, you take the mocks with you in your commits. Complete control over your situation!
> We believe that you don't have to change production code to mock external connections.

## Usage

### How Twins mocks work
Twins mocks are divided into 2 parts. The `when` part and the `response` part. If the `when` callback returns true, the `response` callback is returned.
```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

return [

    'when' => function (Request $request): bool {
        return
            $request->isMethod('GET') &&
            preg_match('#^https?\://api.webshop.nl/products/1#', $request->fullUrl());
    },

    'response' => function (Collection $transport): array {
        return [
            'status'  => 200,
            'headers' => [
                'Content-Type'   => 'application/json;charset=utf-8',
                'content-length' => '275',
            ],
            'body'    => '
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Product name",
                    "price": "2.30",
                    "status": "publish"
                }
            ',
        ];
    },
];
```
> Remember: Twin makes this automatically for you. You only have to adjust it to your needs.

### Match a mock file
Because you want complete control over your mock files, you can use regex to determine when your mock file should be used.
```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

return [

    'when' => function (Request $request): bool {
        return
            $request->isMethod('GET') &&
            preg_match('#^https?\://api.webshop.nl/products/1#', $request->fullUrl());
    },
```
> You can make your `when` clean and structured by not making your regex too long.

### Response
You can determine yourself what your response should be. You can define what the status, headers and body should be.
```php
    'response' => function (Collection $transport): array {
        return [
            'status'  => 200,
            'headers' => [
                'Content-Type'   => 'application/json;charset=utf-8',
                'content-length' => '275',
            ],
            'body'    => '
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Product name",
                    "price": "2.30",
                    "status": "publish"
                }
            ',
        ];
    },
];
```
> Both json and xml (SOAP) responses are supported.

### Transport
Use _transport_ to transport data to your mock file. In your test, you can send a string or array: 
`\External\Providers\TwinsClient::transport('product_name', $productName);`.
And you can get the variable in your response with `$transport->get('product_name')`:
```php

'response' => function (Collection $transport): array {
        return [
            'status'  => 200,
            'headers' => [...],
            'body'    => '
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "' . $transport->get('product_name') . '",
                    "price": "' . $transport->get('product_price') . '",
                    "status": "publish",
                    "sku": "01120000",
                    "meta_data": []
                }
            ',
        ];
    },
];
```
> TwinsClient push the variable to `twins_transform.json`. The variable can be read from the Twins container. Realise that `\External\Providers\TwinsClient::activate()` empties `twins_transform.php` and `twins_transform.php` file is ignored by git.

## Tips
### Debug:
You can debug the last Twins requests in de `twins_debug.log` file (in your mock directory).
> \External\Providers\TwinsClient::activate() empties `twins_debug.log`. This file should be ignored by git.

### Format
Use your idea to reformat the mocks correctly.

## Installation

### Requirements
You need to run Docker and you need to have knowledge about connecting a volume with your project. 

### Connect the docker volume
[...]

### Composer
To install the Twins SDK into your project, simply use `$ composer require reindert-vetter/twins-sdk`

### Activate Twins
You have to place `\External\Providers\TwinsClient::activate()` in your setUp() or bootstrap method so that Twins knows that a new test is starting.

### Calling Twins
Instead of making a call to an external server, you have to make a call to the Twins container. So you don't have to make a call to `api.facebook.com` but you have to make a call to `twins/api.facebook.com`. If you have configured Twins correctly, this will happen automatically. See `config/twins.php` to configure Twins correctly.
